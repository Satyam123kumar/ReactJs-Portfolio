## React.js Portfolio: Collection of 6 Basic Projects

### Project 1: - Image Slider With API Integration
* Utilizes React's Fetch API to fetch image data from an external source
* Dynamically renders images fetched from the API, allowing for easy updates and scalability
* Provides intuitive navigation controls for users to manually browse through images or directly go to particular image

### Project 2: - Load More Data With API Integration
* Implements a "Load More" button that triggers subsequent API requests to fetch the new set of 20 data points every time we click.
* Disables the "Load More" button and displays a message once the total count of fetched data reaches 100, indicating that the limit has been reached.
* Optimizes rendering performance by updating the UI incrementally with new data, providing a smooth user experience.
