### Project 2: - Load More Data with API Integration
* Implements a "Load More" button that triggers subsequent API requests to fetch the new set of 20 data points every time we click.
* Disables the "Load More" button and displays a message once the total count of fetched data reaches 100, indicating that the limit has been reached.
* Optimizes rendering performance by updating the UI incrementally with new data, providing a smooth user experience.
